# SigmaVim
This is basically my dot files for my nvim set up.

## How to Setup
First step is to install the latest version of neovim on your device. The entire set up was built at Nvim version 0.9.1 .

First Install Packer
```shell
git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim  ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
